# Project-2---UI-UX-Design-with-Streamlit
Streamlit code and setup used for my second project in CAP4104 Human Interaction. To run this code, type 'streamlit run main.py' into your IDE's terminal. YouTube link to a video demonstration: https://youtu.be/kerbWEPRHiA

REPORT/DOCUMENTATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This app is called the Weather Dashboard and was made using Streamlit as well as OpenWeather's API. The purpose of this app is to inform users of the weather, humidity, and wind from wherever they choose. 

The overall usability goals for this app were to:
1. Have users enter the location from where they want to check the weather
2. Create a history report so that users could compare data
3. Let users choose the date and time so they can check the weather from yesterday, tomorrow, etc;
4. Include an interactive map for users

These goals were all accomplished by following streamlit guides and online tutorials. The API was integrated quite easily as OpenWeather makes creating the key and implementing it into the code quite simple. The app adheres to the HCI principles as it has success, error, and info boxes to provide immediate reponses to the user. It also gives users control over which area they would like to see the weather from. It is also quite minimalistic and simple to navigate which will make it easier for first time users.

As for improvements, I think I could improve the map by adding colors or importing a satelitte version. The bar chart visualizing the humidity, temperature, and wind could also use some visual updates as well.
